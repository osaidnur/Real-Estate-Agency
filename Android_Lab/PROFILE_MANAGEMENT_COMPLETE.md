# Profile Management Feature - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Summary of Implementation

I have successfully implemented a complete profile management system for the Real Estate Android application. Here's what was accomplished:

### ðŸ”§ Database Enhancements

**Added to UserQueries.java:**
- `UPDATE_USER_PROFILE` query for updating user profile information
- `UPDATE_USER_PASSWORD` query for updating user passwords

**Added to DataBaseHelper.java:**
- `updateUserProfile()` method - Updates first name, last name, phone, and profile photo
- `updateUserPassword()` method - Updates password with current password verification

### ðŸ“± ProfileFragment Enhancements

**Real Database Integration:**
- Loads current user data using `SharedPrefManager.getCurrentUserId()`
- Retrieves user information from database using `getUserById()`
- Updates profile information directly to database
- Validates and updates passwords with proper hashing

**Enhanced Photo Management:**
- Photo selection using system image picker
- Temporary storage in SharedPreferences during editing session
- Permanent storage in database when profile is saved
- Automatic photo loading on profile open
- Support for both database-stored and temporarily-stored photos

**Improved User Experience:**
- Real-time form validation
- Clear success/error feedback via Toast messages
- Automatic form clearing after successful password update
- Loading of actual user data instead of placeholder text

### ðŸ”’ Security Features

**Password Management:**
- Current password verification before allowing updates
- Password hashing using `PasswordUtils.hashPasswordSimple()`
- Strong password validation (8+ characters, uppercase, number, special character)
- Backward compatibility with existing password formats

**Session Management:**
- Proper user session validation
- Current user ID tracking via SharedPreferences
- Secure data access controls

### âš¡ Performance Optimizations

**Fast Database Operations:**
- Efficient SQL queries with prepared statements
- Minimal data transfer (only modified fields)
- Proper cursor management and resource cleanup

**Quick Response Times:**
- Immediate photo preview upon selection
- Temporary storage for instant feedback
- URI-based photo storage (no file copying required)
- Fast profile data loading

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

**Created ProfileTestUtils.java:**
- Automated testing methods for profile updates
- Password update verification
- Data integrity checking
- Error handling validation

### ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The profile management system is now fully functional with:

âœ… **Real database integration** - All data is stored and retrieved from SQLite database
