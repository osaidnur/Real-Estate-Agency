# Customer Navigation Drawer Profile Photo Fix

## Issue Description
User profile photos were appearing as white/blank images in the customer navigation drawer, even when valid photos were stored in the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a white color tint (`android:tint="@android:color/white"`) being applied to the ImageView in the XML layout. This tint was affecting ALL images loaded into the ImageView, including real user profile photos.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Removed XML Tint**
- Removed `android:tint="@android:color/white"` from the ImageView in `nav_header.xml`
- This prevents the white tint from being applied to all images by default

### 2. **Improved Photo Loading Logic**
- Added proper clearing of filters and backgrounds when loading real photos:
  ```java
  userProfilePhoto.setBackground(null);
  userProfilePhoto.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);
  userProfilePhoto.clearColorFilter();
  ```

### 3. **Enhanced Default Icon Handling**
- Updated `setDefaultProfilePhoto()` method to properly apply styling only for default icons
- Clear any existing styling before applying default styling
- Only apply white tint to the default person icon, not user photos

### 4. **Added Debug Logging**
- Added console logging to help troubleshoot photo loading issues
- Logs successful loads, decode failures, and exceptions

## Key Changes Made

### `nav_header.xml`
- Removed `android:tint="@android:color/white"` from ImageView

### `HomeActivity.java`
- Reordered photo loading logic to clear styling before setting bitmap
- Enhanced `setDefaultProfilePhoto()` method with proper cleanup
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

## Result
- Real user profile photos now display correctly without white tint
- Default icons still have beautiful gradient background with white tint
- Proper error handling for missing or corrupted image files
- Better debugging capabilities for future issues

## Technical Details
- **Problem**: XML tint applied to all images
- **Solution**: Apply tint only programmatically for default icons
- **Method**: Use `clearColorFilter()` before loading real photos
- **Fallback**: Enhanced default icon with gradient background
